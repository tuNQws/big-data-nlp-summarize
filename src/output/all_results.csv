"How to not get caught up in comparisons? This is probably something many people here experience.

I'm a younger person and I'm on track to being  HENRY, and although I recognise I'm in a great situation and I'm grateful to have what I have, I'm
always comparing myself to those who have more. 

I have mates who went to Oxford who got really high paying jobs, and even though I also have a high paying job, they make a lot more than I do. I know their jobs come with a lot of stress but their salary scales quickly each year and can make 50%+ bonus easily. 

I know ""comparison is the thief of joy"" yada yada but how do you actually stop getting caught up with comparisons and ""keeping up with the joneses""? 

It's something that many high earners still fall into the trap of - you see so many high earners still living paycheck to paycheck or complaining that they ""can't afford to save money"" despite earning high 6 figure salaries but when you look into their expenditure the 'bare minimum' is expensive cars, expensive watches and multiple holidays, costly private schools/nurseries for their kids etc - all to mostly keep up with their other high earning friends in their social circles.

"IDR Application question Hi all, hoping that someone may have encountered this problem on FSA before and has advice for how to proceed.

I have been in SAVE limbo and after a few months of doing nothing (due to fatigue and feeling discouraged after my IBR application seemed to just miss the review cutoff back in February) I am trying to get back on IBR so I can start making payments (I‚Äôm a little over halfway and just got back into public service in January). I went to FSA today and completed the IDR application. I downloaded the completed application and noticed that even though I indicated when I started that I wanted to switch my current IDR plan, on the form, ‚ÄúI am submitting documentation early to have my income-driven payment recalculated immediately‚Äù is what is checked.

I thought maybe I made a mistake, so I submitted another one, but I saw the same problem. I ended up revoking my IRS consent because I also noticed that the application wasn‚Äôt showing my family size, and the only way to have my dependent included was to remove IRS access so I could manually answer that question. I also had a significant drop in income since going back to public and despite answering the question about that, that box (as well as the questions about whether I have taxable income) are both unchecked, despite the fact that I checked them.

Has anyone encountered issues with their FSA application reflecting their responses correctly? I don‚Äôt want to keep submitting these via FSA if they‚Äôre incorrect, but I am unsure whether the wet signature/upload to servicer is still recommended.

Thanks in advance üôèüèª",study studying help
